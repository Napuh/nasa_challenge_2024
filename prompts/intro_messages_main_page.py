    "Climate change is one of the greatest environmental challenges of our time, "
    "largely driven by the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere. "
    "Among these gases, carbon dioxide (CO₂) is one of the primary contributors, mainly due to human activities "
    "such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and certain industrial processes. \nThis rise in CO₂ levels is "
    "fueling global warming, which in turn is affecting climate patterns, causing polar ice melt, sea-level rise, "
    "and triggering extreme weather events.\n\n"
    "To access updated measurement data on CO₂ concentrations, you can visit the NASA GHG Center:"
