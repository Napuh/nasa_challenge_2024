GAIA - Storytelling with Generative AI based on grounded climate data.

We chose "Tell us a climate story!" challenge to educate people on climate change.

GAIA is based on a chat-style app where you can actively interact with an AI.

It focuses on climate education, using data from official sources, like NASA, ensuring accurate insights.

We curated data from GHG Center to make it easier to understand for humans, using visuals and explanations.

Our goal is to enhance and promote this app to provide data-driven information for people to understand the issue and take action.
