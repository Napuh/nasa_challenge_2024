    "Global temperatures are rising due to increased greenhouse gas emissions since the Industrial Revolution. This change is evident worldwide, causing extreme weather, glacier melting, and rising sea levels, which disrupt ecosystems and communities.",
    "The uneven warming of the planet, especially in regions like the Arctic, leads to rapid ice loss and severe weather events such as hurricanes and droughts. These impacts are particularly harsh on poorer regions with less resilient infrastructure.",
    "Rising temperatures are a current issue, affecting food security, displacing populations, and creating 'climate refugees.' Efforts to combat this include renewable energy adoption and international agreements like the Paris Agreement, but more action is needed to mitigate these global challenges.",
    "Do you have questions about climate change and its impacts? Feel free to ask!",
